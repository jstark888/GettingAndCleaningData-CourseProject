# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Description:

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Included in this repository are:

1. CodeBook.md - Code book that explains the transformations performed on the original dataset and the variables present in the tranformed dataset.
2. features_info.txt - Explains the meaning of the variables in the original dataset (from the creators of the original dataset).
3. run_analyis.R - R script that performs creates the transformed (tidy) dataset explained in the code book.
